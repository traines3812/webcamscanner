# webcamscanner

This script uses the cv2 (OpenCV) library to connect to a webcam using its URL. In this example, the URL is set to http://192.168.1.1:8080/video, but you can replace this with the URL of your own webcam. The script then uses the cv2.VideoCapture function to connect to the webcam and checks if the connection was successful by using the isOpened method.
